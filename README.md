# Supplementary data for the manuscript titled Profiling the transcriptomic age of single-cells in humans

## Abstract
Although aging clocks predicting the age of individual organisms have been extensively studied, the age of individual cells remained largely unexplored. Most recently single-cell omics clocks were developed for the mouse, however, profiling the age of human cells is still lacking. To fill this gap, here we use available scRNA-seq data of 1,058,909 blood cells of 508 healthy, human donors (between 19 and 75 years), for developing single-cell transcriptomic clocks and predicting the age of human blood cells. By the application of the proposed cell-type-specific single-cell clocks, our main observations are that (i) naive CD8-positive T cells are transcriptomically younger than CD8-positive memory T cells; (ii) the transcriptomic age of classical monocyte cells is decreased in COVID-19 subjects; and (iii) the transcriptomic age of cells decreased followed by an increase during embryonic development. In summary, here we demonstrate that single-cell transcriptomic clocks are useful tools to investigate the aging process at the single-cell level.
